### Publish & View Data

The setup to publish data is a 2-step process

1. Run [venv.ps1](./venv.ps1) to create a virtual environment.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependent packages.  When doing this make sure the virtual environment is first activated [as seen here](./docs/images/report-publish-python-1.png).

To view the published data do the following.

1. Navigate to the data viewer page (`http://localhost:3000/data-viewer`) and refresh the page
2. Choose the various datasets from the dropdown.
